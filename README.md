# BFS 5-Tile Puzzle Solver

A Python implementation of a BFS solver for a 5-tile puzzle with 2 A's, 2 B's, and an empty space. Moves follow strict rules for A and B, and the program finds the shortest path from a given start state to the goal state, showing success or failure if it reached a blocked state.

## Features

- Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for puzzle solving  
- Generates all valid child states based on the position of the empty slot  
- Detects and reports if the goal state is found or if the puzzle is blocked  
- Color-coded console output for success and failure messages  

## Requirements

- Python 3.13.3

## Usage

- When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the start state and the goal state.
- Both states must be 5 characters long and consist of exactly two 'A's, two 'B's, and one underscore `_` representing the empty slot.
- Example valid input: `AA_BB` or `BBA_A`
- The program will then perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest sequence of moves to transform the start state into the goal state.
- It respects the puzzle rules where 'A' pieces can move or jump to the right, and 'B' pieces can move or jump to the left, swapping positions with the empty slot.
- The program outputs the solution path if the goal was reached, or the path to the blocked state if the problem is an unsolvable combination
- It indicates success if the goal is reached, or failure if the puzzle is unsolvable (blocked state).

## Example
How it should work and show you in the console:  
Hello, this code is used to transform a list from one state to another,  
there are 2 As and 2 Bs and one empty slot(block) all the time, aka a list of 5 positions,  
valid movees are:  
&nbsp;A moving to the right one block to swap with empty slot, or A jumping over one block also to the right to fill the empty slot  
&nbsp;B moving to the left one block to swap with empty slot, or B jumping over one block also to the left to fill the empty slot        
Enter your start state (use _ for empty square): aa_bb  
Enter your goal state (use _ for empty square): bb_aa  
Your Start State is: AA_BB  
Your Goal State is: BB_AA  
['A', 'A', '\_', 'B', 'B']  
['A', '\_', 'A', 'B', 'B']  
['A', 'B', 'A', '\_', 'B']  
['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', '\_']  
['A', 'B', '\_', 'B', 'A']  
['\_', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']  
['B', '\_', 'A', 'B', 'A']  
['B', 'B', 'A', '\_', 'A']  
['B', 'B', '_', 'A', 'A']  
Success, Goal Found!!!
